(R) Races: admins can define unique races in addition to default race and class types. IE: race of wormy characters,
	so specialized armour, clothing, weapons. Perhaps unique data points for locations like belly armour, antenna 
	weapon points..	Add race specific setting on all item objects.

(R) Size as well as race: chars can be small, fat, large, tall, wispy, massively muscled, normal, have tails..
	-- suggests gear can be size and race specific at the same time, new gear can be made on the fly after a new race
		has been created. Add size/race specific settings on all gear? 
		Abstract datatype arrays on characters for unknown attributes/data-points at compile time. 
		Dynamic casting, reflection and pointer manipulation likely.

(R) Builder: Area specific, a grid like view of the area's rooms, with links between them based on the rooms
	exit directions, perhaps two views, top down, and side on for depth visuals.
	-- suggests a compass like data-point in exit linkage for mapping directions, up down, n, e, s, w, ne, nw..
	-- suggests indirectly, distance data-point in the linkage for the mapper as well.

(C) Mapper: World view, ability to search for a player/mob and show location on map. Perhaps show all players on map
	in live mode as they move about..
