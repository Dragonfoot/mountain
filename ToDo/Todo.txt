(R) Races: admins can define unique races in addition to default race and class types. IE: race of wormy characters,
	so specialized armour, clothing, weapons. Perhaps unique data points for locations like belly armour, antenna 
	weapon points..	Add race specific setting on all item objects.

(R) Size as well as race: chars can be small, fat, large, tall, wispy, massively muscled, normal, have tails..
	-- suggests gear can be size and race specific at the same time, new gear can be made on the fly after a new race
		has been created. Add size/race specific settings on all gear? 
		Abstract datatype arrays on characters for unknown attributes/data-points at compile time. 
		Dynamic casting, reflection and pointer manipulation likely.

(R) Builder: Area specific, a grid like view of the area's rooms, with links between them based on the rooms
	exit directions, perhaps two views, top down, and side on for depth visuals.
	-- suggests a compass like data-point in exit linkage for mapping directions, up down, n, e, s, w, ne, nw..
	-- suggests indirectly, distance data-point in the linkage for the mapper as well.

(C) Mapper: World view, ability to search for a player/mob and show location on map. Perhaps show all players on map
	in live mode as they move about..

(C/R) - lag feature
      - multi world hand offs, item/mob mapping between worlds
      - player set,  per player settings, lag commands, verbose, output types
      - main output class - output in plain or ascii mode dependent on player preference.
      - first iteration to be a server/client in one project
(C)   - ANSI features.  create an ansi class to modify output to ansi
(C/R) - room flags for "areaset" or "roomset" mobs lists
      - AI actions for mobs to have random action based on level/class ie: {thief}(minlevel}{maxlevel}{action}
      - more complex citizenry.  don't want 90% of the area empty with just spawn camping
        ie: {area}{mob}{levelmin}{levelmax}{random%}
      - need function opposite of "lag detect".  if 5 commands received in 5 second, agro mob can stop the player type function
(C/R) - address the need to compile for simple things as new commands, emotes, etc.
        hard code base functions, grouping by command function.
